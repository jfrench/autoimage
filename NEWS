# 1.0   Add pimage function to create individual projected images.  
        Create autolegend to manually add legend to image created
        by pimage.  Update autoimage to rely on pimage and autolegend.
        Add plines, ppoints, etc., functions to add lines, points, 
        etc., to existing images created by pimage.  Create helper
        function to make plot similar to autoimage using ggplot2.
        Introduce incompatibilities with version 0.3.1.  Add vignette
        with examples of package capabilities.  Update License because
        of importation of akima package.
        
# 1.1   Update package to suggest akima package.  Done for GPL 
        reasons.  User must install akima manually.

# 1.2   Update vignette and narccap data documentation to correct
        error in climate models.  
        
# 1.3   Add text capability to pimage and autoimage.  Add new
        vignette comparing autoimage and ggplot2. Improve blank.plot()
        by reducing margins before plotting, returning to previous
        margins.  Changed behavior of lratio in autoimage
        to adapt to number of images being plotted.
        
# 2.0   Use MBA::mba.surf for grid interpolation instead of
        akima::interp because of rescrictive licensing.
        Update behavior of lratio to adapt based on the
        number of images being plotted.  Add inarccap data.

# 2.0.1 Fix small bug related to us.cities in
        ggplot2-comparison vignette.

# 2.1   Add autopoints and heat_ppoints functions to create
        heated scatterplots. Added autopoints vignette.

# 2.1.1 Improve zlim axis tick labels for autopoints using
        pretty function. Can still override using zlim
        or breaks. Add list capability for breaks for 
        autopoints.
# 2.1.2 Update heat_ppoints to have n argument, similar to
        autopoints.
# 2.1.3 Update arglist_clean to clean legend.mar from
        arglist.
# 2.1.6 Fix bug when projection produces NA x and y values.
        Make the pimage function more modular. Update
        autoimage vignette.
