# 1.0 - Add pimage function to create individual projected images.  
        Create autolegend to manually add legend to image created
        by pimage.  Update autoimage to rely on pimage and autolegend.
        Add plines, ppoints, etc., functions to add lines, points, 
        etc., to existing images created by pimage.  Create helper
        function to make plot similar to autoimage using ggplot2.
        Introduce incompatibilities with version 0.3.1.  Add vignette
        with examples of package capabilities.  Update License because
        of importation of akima package.
